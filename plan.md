# ShareYourSpace 2.0: Frontend Prototype Development Plan

**Objective:** To build a high-fidelity, interactive frontend prototype using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and dummy data. The application will be fully responsive and deployable to Vercel.

**Guiding Principle:** Emulate the "Airbnb look and feel"â€”clean, spacious, photo-first, intuitive, and trustworthy.

---

## Phase 0: Project Foundation & Setup

*(**Goal:** Initialize the project, install all necessary tools, and create the central dummy data file.)*

**Prompt 0.1: Project Initialization**
"Initialize a new Next.js project named `shareyourspace-prototype` in this directory. Use TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and the App Router. Also, initialize a new Git repository for it."

**Prompt 0.2: Installing Dependencies**
"We need to add a few libraries to our project. Please install the following dependencies:
*   `zustand` for state management.
*   `framer-motion` for animations.
*   `recharts` for admin dashboard charts.
*   `lucide-react` for a high-quality icon library."

**Prompt 0.3: Folder Structure**
"Create a standard, organized folder structure inside the `app/` directory. The structure should be:
*   `components/` (for reusable UI components)
    *   `global/` (for sitewide components like Header, Footer)
    *   `ui/` (for small, generic components like custom buttons or cards)
    *   `pages/` (for components specific to a single page)
*   `lib/` (for helper functions and our dummy data)
*   `store/` (for our Zustand state management store)"

**Prompt 0.4: Tailwind CSS Configuration**
"Let's configure Tailwind CSS for a clean, Airbnb-like aesthetic. Open `tailwind.config.ts` and extend the theme. Add a custom font family (e.g., Inter), and define a primary brand color. For now, let's use a modern, trustworthy blue, but we can change it later. Also, ensure the JIT compiler is configured to scan all our component directories for class names."

**Prompt 0.5: Dummy Data Structure (The "Brain" of the Prototype)**
"This is a critical step. Create a new file at `lib/dummy-data.ts`. In this file, define and export a comprehensive set of dummy data. The structure should include:
1.  An array of `User` objects. Each user needs an `id`, `name`, `email`, `role` (`corporate-host`, `pro-provider`, `member`, `sys-admin`, `hub-ambassador`), `profileImageUrl`, `company`, `title`, and `bio`. Create at least one of each role.
2.  An array of `Space` objects. Each space needs an `id`, `title`, `hostId` (linking to a User), `type` (`Corporate Hub` or `Pro Workspace`), `location`, `pricePerMonth`, `pricePerDay`, an array of `imageUrls`, an array of `amenities`, and a `description`.
3.  An array of `BookingProduct` objects for each space, detailing `type` (Day Pass, Monthly Desk), `price`, and `quantity`.
4.  An array of `Review` objects, each with a `spaceId`, `userId`, `rating`, and `comment`.
5.  An array of `Match` objects for a specific member, each with a `targetUserId` and a hardcoded `matchReason`.
6.  An array of `ChatMessage` objects for a specific conversation, creating a scripted dialogue."

**Prompt 0.6: Global State Management (Zustand)**
"Create a new file at `store/authStore.ts`. Set up a Zustand store to handle our simulated authentication. The store should contain:
*   `isAuthenticated`: a boolean.
*   `currentUser`: a `User` object or `null`.
*   A `login` function that takes a user `email`, finds the corresponding user in our `dummy-data.ts` file, and sets `isAuthenticated` to true and `currentUser` to that user object.
*   A `logout` function that resets the store to its initial state."

---

## Phase 1: Global Components & Public Pages

*(**Goal:** Build the main public-facing parts of the application to establish the visual identity.)*

**Prompt 1.1: Header and Footer**
"Create two new components: `Header.tsx` and `Footer.tsx` inside `app/components/global/`.
*   **Header:** It should be clean and sticky, with the logo on the left. On the right, include 'List Your Space' and a user profile icon button that will later trigger the login modal.
*   **Footer:** A simple, multi-column footer with dummy links for 'Company', 'Explore', and 'Support'.
*   Now, integrate both into the main `app/layout.tsx` so they appear on every page."

**Prompt 1.2: The Homepage (Feature G-1)**
"Let's build the homepage at `app/page.tsx`.
1.  Create a visually stunning hero section with a full-width background image/video and the central search bar on top.
2.  Below the hero, create a `DiscoverySection` component that takes a title (e.g., "Explore Corporate Hubs") and a list of spaces from our dummy data, and renders them in a horizontally scrolling carousel of `SpaceCard` components.
3.  Use this `DiscoverySection` component three times on the homepage for different categories of spaces."

**Prompt 1.3: The Reusable Space Card Component**
"Create a new component `app/components/ui/SpaceCard.tsx`. This card is crucial for the Airbnb feel. It should display:
1.  A high-quality image with a subtle 'heart' icon for wishlisting.
2.  The space title and location in clean typography.
3.  The price per month.
4.  A dummy star rating."

**Prompt 1.4: The Space Listing Page (Feature G-3)**
"Create a dynamic page at `app/spaces/[id]/page.tsx`.
1.  Fetch the space data from `dummy-data.ts` based on the `id` from the URL.
2.  The top of the page should be a beautiful, responsive photo gallery.
3.  Below the gallery, create a two-column layout.
4.  **Left Column:** Display the listing title, host information (differentiating between Corporate Host and Pro Workspace with its Hub Ambassador), description, amenities, and dummy reviews.
5.  **Right Column (Desktop):** Create a sticky `BookingWidget.tsx` component. This widget should let the user select a booking type (Day Pass/Monthly), show the calculated price, and have a 'Book Now' button."

**Prompt 1.5: The Login/Signup Modal (Feature G-4)**
"Create a reusable `AuthModal.tsx` component.
1.  When the user profile icon in the header is clicked, this modal should appear.
2.  It should have tabs for 'Log In' and 'Sign Up'.
3.  The 'Log In' tab has fields for email and password. When a user logs in with a dummy email, it should call the `authStore.login()` function and close the modal.
4.  The 'Sign Up' flow should be simulated, eventually leading to a login action."

## Phase 2: The "Community Member" Authenticated Journey

*(**Goal:** Build the complete, seamless experience for a logged-in freelancer or startup member.)*

**Prompt 2.1: Member Dashboard Layout**
"Create a new layout for authenticated users. It should include a sidebar navigation with icons for 'Dashboard', 'Discover', 'Messages', and 'My Account'. This layout should wrap all pages under a new `/member` route group."

**Prompt 2.2: The Member Dashboard Page (Feature M-1)**
"Create the main dashboard page at `app/member/dashboard/page.tsx`.
1.  It should pull the `currentUser` from the `authStore` to display a personalized welcome message.
2.  Display a prominent 'Booking Status' widget.
3.  The main feature should be a horizontally scrolling module titled 'Discover New Connections', which renders a list of `MatchCard` components based on dummy data."

**Prompt 2.3: The Reusable Match Card Component (Feature M-2a)**
"Create a new component `app/components/ui/MatchCard.tsx`. This card should display:
1.  The user's profile picture, name, and role.
2.  The hardcoded `matchReason` from our dummy data, styled as a prominent quote to highlight it.
3.  A 'Connect' button that, when clicked, changes its own state to 'Request Sent' (client-side only)."

**Prompt 2.4: The High-Fidelity Chat Simulation (Feature M-3)**
"Create a new page at `app/member/messages/page.tsx`.
1.  Implement a two-panel layout. The left panel lists all of the user's 'connections' from the dummy data.
2.  Clicking a connection opens the conversation in the right panel.
3.  The right panel should display the scripted conversation from `dummy-data.ts` in a beautiful chat bubble interface.
4.  Include a text input at the bottom. Typing and sending a message should add it to the chat UI instantly."

## Phase 3: The "Host" Authenticated Experience

*(**Goal:** Build the tailored dashboards and tools for both types of hosts.)*

**Prompt 3.1: The Host Dashboard Shell**
"Create a new route group at `/host`. The main page, `/host/dashboard/page.tsx`, should be a smart component. It should check the `currentUser.role` from the `authStore`.
*   If the role is `corporate-host`, render a `<CorporateHostDashboard />` component.
*   If the role is `pro-provider`, render a `<ProfessionalProviderDashboard />` component."

**Prompt 3.2: The Corporate Host Dashboard (Feature H-2)**
"Create the `CorporateHostDashboard.tsx` component.
1.  It should focus on 'Community & Synergy' widgets.
2.  The hero feature is the 'AI Recruiting Agent'. This is a text area where the user can type. Clicking 'Search' will show a loading animation and then display a pre-defined list of dummy user results, demonstrating the feature."

**Prompt 3.3: The Professional Provider Dashboard (Feature H-3)**
"Create the `ProfessionalProviderDashboard.tsx` component.
1.  It should focus on 'Business Performance' widgets like Occupancy and Revenue.
2.  If the dummy data indicates multiple properties, show a 'Portfolio View'.
3.  Include a module for the 'AI Anchor Tenant Finder' and a simple section showing the profile of their assigned 'Hub Ambassador'."

**Prompt 3.4: Common Host Tools (Feature H-1)**
"Create a new page at `/host/listings/page.tsx`.
1.  This page should display a list of the host's properties from the dummy data.
2.  Include a prominent section for the 'Availability & Pricing Engine', a UI that clearly shows the different booking products (Day Pass, etc.) and allows for (simulated) editing of price and quantity."

---

## Phase 4: The "Platform Admin" View

*(**Goal:** Demonstrate the oversight capabilities for the ShareYourSpace team.)*

**Prompt 4.1: The Admin Dashboard**
"Create a new route group `/admin`. The main page at `/admin/dashboard/page.tsx` should be protected, only rendering if the `currentUser.role` is `sys-admin`.
1.  The dashboard should feature large, clear charts using the `recharts` library, visualizing the KPI data from `dummy-data.ts`.
2.  Include widgets that compare the performance of 'Corporate Hubs' vs. 'Pro Workspaces'."

**Prompt 4.2: Admin Management Tables**
"Create pages under `/admin` for 'Users' and 'Listings'. Each page should display a clean, searchable table of all the corresponding items from our dummy data, with buttons for simulated actions like 'Verify' or 'Feature'."

---

## Phase 5: Finalization & Deployment

*(**Goal:** Polish the application and get it live on the web.)*

**Prompt 5.1: Responsiveness Check**
"Let's go through every page and component we've built (`HomePage`, `ListingPage`, `Dashboard`, etc.) and ensure they are fully responsive. Use Tailwind's responsive breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`) to adjust layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop. The mobile experience should be as clean and usable as the desktop one."

**Prompt 5.2: Adding Motion & Polish**
"Now, let's use `framer-motion` to add subtle, professional animations to elevate the user experience.
1.  Animate the appearance of cards in the `DiscoverySection` and `MatchCard` grids using a staggered fade-in effect.
2.  Add a smooth transition effect to page changes.
3.  Animate the opening and closing of modals."

**Prompt 5.3: Deployment to Vercel**
"This project is ready for deployment.
1.  Push the entire project to a new GitHub repository.
2.  Log in to Vercel and create a new project, importing from that GitHub repository.
3.  Vercel should automatically detect that it's a Next.js project and configure the build settings correctly.
4.  Deploy the project. Once it's live, provide me with the final URL."
